## How to run the program
You must have PDFMerger.py and Module1.py in the same directory. You must also have PyPDF2 installed (`pip install PyPDF2` in the command line works).

Then, simply open the PDFMerger.py file with python, either by right-clicking it or navigating to its directory in the command line.  
Or, if you prefer, open it with the IDE of your choice and run from there.

## How to use
Press 'Add PDF' to select the PDFs you wish to merge.

You can also remove any PDFs in the list by selecting the PDFs and pressing 'Remove'.

Press 'Merge!', choose a file name and directory, and press 'Save' to finish.

## Known issue
Some encrypted PDFs (e.g. those obtained from scanning a document) don't allow the program to edit them. One workaround is to duplicate the PDF by printing it to PDF.
